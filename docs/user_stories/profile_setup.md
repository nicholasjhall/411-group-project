# Profile Setup

**As a new, logged-in user, I want to complete my user profile so that I donâ€™t have to input my preferences every time.**

Once the user has followed "sign in" story, they will be prompted to complete their profile setup. They will fill out a few forms about themselves, such as their location and food preferences. They do not need to complete this setup before moving on to create plans, and they can skip through it. They can always click on their profile to edit their information if they would like to make a change.
