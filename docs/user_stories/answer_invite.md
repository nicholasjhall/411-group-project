# Answer Invite

**As a logged-in user, I want to accept or reject my friendâ€™s invitation so that I can choose whether to join their event.**

A new plan will appear under the user's event list as "pending". The user can either click the accept button or the reject button. If the accept button is chosen, then the event status changes to "confirmed". Anything about the event can then be changed through the "modify event" user story. If the reject button is chosen, then the user is prompted for a reason, and the event status changes to "rejected: reason".
