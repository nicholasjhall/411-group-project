# Technology Stack

Our full stack is React frontend with Flask backend and MongoDB for the database.

We decided to use React on the frontend because two of us already had experience with React and the rest of us were interested in learning it. In general, we felt that it was an easier framework to pick up than Angular or Vue and we liked the component-based nature of the framework. 

For the backend, we were deciding between Node with Express, Flask, and Django. Several of our members had experience with Python but not Javascript, so we opted to use a Python-based framework. Since some of us had used Flask but not Django, we decided on Flask.

For the database, we had experience with MySQL and MongoDB, so we chose between those. We thought that it would be simpler and more efficient to use a NoSQL database as we did not have that many entity relationships, so we could just use document-based storage.
