# Cancel Event

**As a user with a planned event, I want to cancel my event so that I can change my mind.**

After a plan has been created and exists in the event list, either user can click on the "cancel" button and provide a reason. The user will be prompted to confirm that they want to cancel the event. If they confirm, the event status will changed to "cancelled: reason".
