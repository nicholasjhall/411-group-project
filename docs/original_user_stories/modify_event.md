# Modify Event

**As a user with a planned event, I want to modify my events so that I can still go out if my schedule changes.**

Once atleast one plan has been created from the "create event" user story, either user can click on "modify", and they can change any details about the event, then click "propose". The event status will change to "change proposed" for the other user, and they will have to accept or reject the change. If they accept the change, then the status changes to "change confirmed". If reject is chosen, the user must select a reason and the status displays "change rejected: reason". Both users can repeat this process as many times as desired.
