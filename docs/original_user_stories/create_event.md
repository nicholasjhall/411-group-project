# Create Event

**As a logged-in user, I want to create an event so that I can invite my friend to a specific plan.**

The user will click on a button to create a new event, then enter the unique ID of their friend and follow the "filter select" user story. hen the user will click the "send invite" button. If the user's unique ID is invalid, then no event is created and an error is shown. A successfully created invite will be shown as pending under their event list, and can be edited according to the "modify event" user story.
