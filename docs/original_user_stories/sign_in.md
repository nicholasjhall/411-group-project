# Sign In

**As a new user, I want to sign in with my Google account so that I can easily work around the schedule on my Google Calendar**

When opening the application, the user will be asked to sign in with their Google account. Then, the application will request access to their Google Calendar. If they grant the application permission, then they can continue to the profile setup story. If they don't grant permission, then the application will just use a default work schedule when creating plans.
