# Select Filters

**As a user that is creating an event, I want to select filters so that I can find the best event for my preferences.**

During the "create event" story, the user will be able to select from several options for the event. They will be able to select their default preferences for time, location, food type, or restaurants, or they can enter specific values for these fields. If a value is not filled in for any or all fields, then the user can click "suggest" for each field to fill in a suggested choice. The user will only be able to click the "send invite" button once all fields are filled.
